        <p>Pork katsu, a popular Japanese dish, showcases the perfect fusion of crispy, golden-brown breading and succulent pork cutlets. To prepare pork katsu, thinly sliced pork loin or pork tenderloin is tenderized, seasoned, coated in flour, dipped in beaten eggs, and finally coated with panko breadcrumbs before being deep-fried to a crisp perfection. The result is a crunchy exterior that gives way to juicy, flavorful pork with every bite. Pork katsu is often served with a tangy and savory tonkatsu sauce, which adds depth and richness to the dish. This delightful combination of textures and flavors makes pork katsu a beloved comfort food enjoyed by people of all ages in Japan and around the world. </p>

                <li>Fry the Pork Cutlets</li>
