                    <li><h5>Prepare the vegetables</h5></li>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Cut the napa cabbage into quarters, removing the core.</li>
                          <li>Rinse the cabbage quarters under cold water, making sure to get between the leaves.</li>
                          <li>Cut the Korean radish into thin matchsticks or slices. If using other optional vegetables like carrots or Asian chives, prepare them as well.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><h5>Salt the Vegetables</h5></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sprinkle coarse sea salt between the leaves of each cabbage quarter and on the radish slices.</li>
                            <li>Place the salted cabbage and radish in a large bowl or container, and let them sit for 1-2 hours to draw out moisture. Turn them occasionally to ensure even salting.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><h5>Rinse and Drain</h5></li>  
                        <ul>
                            <li>After salting, rinse the cabbage and radish under cold water to remove excess salt.</li>
                            <li>Drain them thoroughly in a colander for about 30 minutes to remove excess moisture.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><h5>Prepare the Kimchi Paste</h5></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In a blender or food processor, combine garlic cloves, ginger, green onions, Korean chili powder (gochugaru), Korean fish sauce (or salted shrimp), and sugar (if using). Blend until you get a smooth paste-like consistency.</li>
                            <li>Optionally, you can add Korean pear or apple to the paste for sweetness.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><h5>Mix the Vegetables and Paste</h5></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the drained cabbage, radish, and any optional vegetables with the kimchi paste. Use gloves to massage the paste into the vegetables, ensuring they are well coated.</li>
                        </ul>    
                    <li><h5>Fermentation</h5></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pack the kimchi tightly into clean jars or airtight containers, pressing down firmly to remove any air bubbles.</li>
                            <li>Leave some space at the top of the container as the kimchi will expand during fermentation.</li>
                            <li>Close the containers tightly and let them ferment at room temperature for 1-2 days, depending on how tangy you prefer your kimchi.</li>
                            <li>After fermenting, transfer the kimchi to the refrigerator to slow down the fermentation process. It can be eaten immediately but will continue to develop flavor over time.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ol>
